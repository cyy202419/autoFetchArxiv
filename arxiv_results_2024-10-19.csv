AutoAL: Automated Active Learning with Differentiable Query Strategy Search,"Yifeng Wang, Xueying Zhan, Siyu Huang",2024-10-17,"As deep learning continues to evolve, the need for data efficiency becomes
increasingly important. Considering labeling large datasets is both
time-consuming and expensive, active learning (AL) provides a promising
solution to this challenge by iteratively selecting the most informative
subsets of examples to train deep neural networks, thereby reducing the
labeling cost. However, the effectiveness of different AL algorithms can vary
significantly across data scenarios, and determining which AL algorithm best
fits a given task remains a challenging problem. This work presents the first
differentiable AL strategy search method, named AutoAL, which is designed on
top of existing AL sampling strategies. AutoAL consists of two neural nets,
named SearchNet and FitNet, which are optimized concurrently under a
differentiable bi-level optimization framework. For any given task, SearchNet
and FitNet are iteratively co-optimized using the labeled data, learning how
well a set of candidate AL algorithms perform on that task. With the optimal AL
strategies identified, SearchNet selects a small subset from the unlabeled pool
for querying their annotations, enabling efficient training of the task model.
Experimental results demonstrate that AutoAL consistently achieves superior
accuracy compared to all candidate AL algorithms and other selective AL
approaches, showcasing its potential for adapting and integrating multiple
existing AL methods across diverse tasks and domains. Code will be available

Learning Graph Quantized Tokenizers for Transformers,"Limei Wang, Kaveh Hassani, Si Zhang, Dongqi Fu, Baichuan Yuan, Weilin Cong, Zhigang Hua, Hao Wu, Ning Yao, Bo Long",2024-10-17,"Transformers serve as the backbone architectures of Foundational Models,
where a domain-specific tokenizer helps them adapt to various domains. Graph
Transformers (GTs) have recently emerged as a leading model in geometric deep
learning, outperforming Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in various graph learning
tasks. However, the development of tokenizers for graphs has lagged behind
other modalities, with existing approaches relying on heuristics or GNNs
co-trained with Transformers. To address this, we introduce GQT (\textbf{G}raph
\textbf{Q}uantized \textbf{T}okenizer), which decouples tokenizer training from
Transformer training by leveraging multi-task graph self-supervised learning,
yielding robust and generalizable graph tokens. Furthermore, the GQT utilizes
Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to learn hierarchical discrete tokens,
resulting in significantly reduced memory requirements and improved
generalization capabilities. By combining the GQT with token modulation, a
Transformer encoder achieves state-of-the-art performance on 16 out of 18
benchmarks, including large-scale homophilic and heterophilic datasets. The

CrystalX: Ultra-Precision Crystal Structure Resolution and Error Correction Using Deep Learning,"Kaipeng Zheng, Weiran Huang, Wanli Ouyang, Han-Sen Zhong, Yuqiang Li",2024-10-17,"Atomic structure analysis of crystalline materials is a paramount endeavor in
both chemical and material sciences. This sophisticated technique necessitates
not only a solid foundation in crystallography but also a profound
comprehension of the intricacies of the accompanying software, posing a
significant challenge in meeting the rigorous daily demands. For the first
time, we confront this challenge head-on by harnessing the power of deep
learning for ultra-precise structural analysis at the full-atom level. To
validate the performance of the model, named CrystalX, we employed a vast
dataset comprising over 50,000 X-ray diffraction measurements derived from
authentic experiments, demonstrating performance that is commensurate with
human experts and adept at deciphering intricate geometric patterns.
Remarkably, CrystalX revealed that even peer-reviewed publications can harbor
errors that are stealthy to human scrutiny, yet CrystalX adeptly rectifies
them. This deep learning model revolutionizes the time frame for crystal
structure analysis, slashing it down to seconds. It has already been
successfully applied in the structure analysis of newly discovered compounds in
the latest research without human intervention. Overall, CrystalX marks the
beginning of a new era in automating routine structural analysis within
self-driving laboratories.",deep learning
On-device Federated Learning in Smartphones for Detecting Depression from Reddit Posts,"Mustofa Ahmed, Abdul Muntakim, Nawrin Tabassum, Mohammad Asifur Rahim, Faisal Muhammad Shah",2024-10-17,"Depression detection using deep learning models has been widely explored in
previous studies, especially due to the large amounts of data available from
social media posts. These posts provide valuable information about individuals'
mental health conditions and can be leveraged to train models and identify
patterns in the data. However, distributed learning approaches have not been
extensively explored in this domain. In this study, we adopt Federated Learning
(FL) to facilitate decentralized training on smartphones while protecting user
data privacy. We train three neural network architectures--GRU, RNN, and LSTM
on Reddit posts to detect signs of depression and evaluate their performance
under heterogeneous FL settings. To optimize the training process, we leverage
a common tokenizer across all client devices, which reduces the computational
load. Additionally, we analyze resource consumption and communication costs on
smartphones to assess their impact in a real-world FL environment. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the federated models achieve comparable
performance to the centralized models. This study highlights the potential of
FL for decentralized mental health prediction by providing a secure and
efficient model training process on edge devices.",deep learning
Label-free prediction of fluorescence markers in bovine satellite cells using deep learning,"Sania Sinha, Aarham Wasit, Won Seob Kim, Jongkyoo Kim, Jiyoon Yi",2024-10-17,"Assessing the quality of bovine satellite cells (BSCs) is essential for the
cultivated meat industry, which aims to address global food sustainability
challenges. This study aims to develop a label-free method for predicting
fluorescence markers in isolated BSCs using deep learning. We employed a
U-Net-based CNN model to predict multiple fluorescence signals from a single
bright-field microscopy image of cell culture. Two key biomarkers, DAPI and
Pax7, were used to determine the abundance and quality of BSCs. The image
pre-processing pipeline included fluorescence denoising to improve prediction
performance and consistency. A total of 48 biological replicates were used,
with statistical performance metrics such as Pearson correlation coefficient
and SSIM employed for model evaluation. The model exhibited better performance
with DAPI predictions due to uniform staining. Pax7 predictions were more
variable, reflecting biological heterogeneity. Enhanced visualization
techniques, including color mapping and image overlay, improved the
interpretability of the predictions by providing better contextual and
perceptual information. The findings highlight the importance of data
pre-processing and demonstrate the potential of deep learning to advance
non-invasive, label-free assessment techniques in the cultivated meat industry,
paving the way for reliable and actionable AI-driven evaluations.",deep learning
Enhanced Prompt-leveraged Weakly Supervised Cancer Segmentation based on Segment Anything,"Joonhyeon Song, Seohwan Yun, Seongho Yoon, Joohyeok Kim, Sangmin Lee",2024-10-17,"This work proposes a novel approach beyond supervised learning for effective
pathological image analysis, addressing the challenge of limited robust labeled
data. Pathological diagnosis of diseases like cancer has conventionally relied
on the evaluation of morphological features by physicians and pathologists.
However, recent advancements in compute-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are
gaining significant attention as diagnostic support tools. Although the
advancement of deep learning has improved CAD significantly, segmentation
models typically require large pixel-level annotated dataset, and such labeling
is expensive. Existing studies not based on supervised approaches still
struggle with limited generalization, and no practical approach has emerged
yet. To address this issue, we present a weakly supervised semantic
segmentation (WSSS) model by combining class activation map and Segment
Anything Model (SAM)-based pseudo-labeling. For effective pretraining, we adopt
the SAM-a foundation model that is pretrained on large datasets and operates in
zero-shot configurations using only coarse prompts. The proposed approach
transfer enhanced Attention Dropout Layer's knowledge to SAM, thereby
generating pseudo-labels. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
method, experimental studies are conducted on histopathological breast cancer
datasets. The proposed method outperformed other WSSS methods across three
datasets, demonstrating its efficiency by achieving this with only 12GB of GPU

Align-ULCNet: Towards Low-Complexity and Robust Acoustic Echo and Noise Reduction,"Shrishti Saha Shetu, Naveen Kumar Desiraju, Wolfgang Mack, Emanuël A. P. Habets",2024-10-17,"The successful deployment of deep learning-based acoustic echo and noise
reduction (AENR) methods in consumer devices has spurred interest in developing
low-complexity solutions, while emphasizing the need for robust performance in
real-life applications. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach to enhance
the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ULCNet model by integrating time alignment and
parallel encoder blocks for the model inputs, resulting in better echo
reduction and comparable noise reduction performance to existing SOTA methods.
We also propose a channel-wise sampling-based feature reorientation method,

Material Fingerprinting: Identifying and Predicting Perceptual Attributes of Material Appearance,"Jiri Filip, Filip Dechterenko, Filipp Schmidt, Jiri Lukavsky, Veronika Vilimovska, Jan Kotera, Roland W. Fleming",2024-10-17,"The world is abundant with diverse materials, each possessing unique surface
appearances that play a crucial role in our daily perception and understanding
of their properties. Despite advancements in technology enabling the capture
and realistic reproduction of material appearances for visualization and
quality control, the interoperability of material property information across
various measurement representations and software platforms remains a complex
challenge. A key to overcoming this challenge lies in the automatic
identification of materials' perceptual features, enabling intuitive
differentiation of properties stored in disparate material data
representations. We reasoned that for many practical purposes, a compact
representation of the perceptual appearance is more useful than an exhaustive
physical description.This paper introduces a novel approach to material
identification by encoding perceptual features obtained from dynamic visual
stimuli. We conducted a psychophysical experiment to select and validate 16
particularly significant perceptual attributes obtained from videos of 347
materials. We then gathered attribute ratings from over twenty participants for
each material, creating a 'material fingerprint' that encodes the unique
perceptual properties of each material. Finally, we trained a multi-layer
perceptron model to predict the relationship between statistical and deep
learning image features and their corresponding perceptual properties. We
demonstrate the model's performance in material retrieval and filtering
according to individual attributes. This model represents a significant step
towards simplifying the sharing and understanding of material properties in
diverse digital environments regardless of their digital representation,
enhancing both the accuracy and efficiency of material identification.",deep learning
Deep-learning recognition and tracking of individual nanotubes in low-contrast microscopy videos,"Vladimir Pimonov, Said Tahir, Vincent Jourdain",2024-10-17,"This study addresses the challenge of analyzing the growth kinetics of carbon
nanotubes using in-situ homodyne polarization microscopy (HPM) by developing an
automated deep learning (DL) approach. A Mask-RCNN architecture, enhanced with
a ResNet-50 backbone, was employed to recognize and track individual nanotubes
in microscopy videos, significantly improving the efficiency and
reproducibility of kinetic data extraction. The method involves a series of
video processing steps to enhance contrast and used differential treatment
techniques to manage low signal and fast kinetics. The DL model demonstrates
consistency with manual measurements and increased throughput, laying the
foundation for statistical studies of nanotube growth. The approach can be
adapted for other types of in-situ microscopy studies, emphasizing the
importance of automation in high-throughput data acquisition for research on
individual nano-objects.",deep learning
OAH-Net: A Deep Neural Network for Hologram Reconstruction of Off-axis Digital Holographic Microscope,"Wei Liu, Kerem Delikoyun, Qianyu Chen, Alperen Yildiz, Si Ko Myo, Win Sen Kuan, John Tshon Yit Soong, Matthew Edward Cove, Oliver Hayden, Hweekuan Lee",2024-10-17,"Off-axis digital holographic microscopy is a high-throughput, label-free
imaging technology that provides three-dimensional, high-resolution information
about samples, particularly useful in large-scale cellular imaging. However,
the hologram reconstruction process poses a significant bottleneck for timely
data analysis. To address this challenge, we propose a novel reconstruction
approach that integrates deep learning with the physical principles of off-axis
holography. We initialized part of the network weights based on the physical
principle and then fine-tuned them via weakly supersized learning. Our off-axis
hologram network (OAH-Net) retrieves phase and amplitude images with errors
that fall within the measurement error range attributable to hardware, and its
reconstruction speed significantly surpasses the microscope's acquisition rate.
Crucially, OAH-Net demonstrates remarkable external generalization capabilities
on unseen samples with distinct patterns and can be seamlessly integrated with
other models for downstream tasks to achieve end-to-end real-time hologram
analysis. This capability further expands off-axis holography's applications in
both biological and medical studies.",deep learning
Fluid: Scaling Autoregressive Text-to-image Generative Models with Continuous Tokens,"Lijie Fan, Tianhong Li, Siyang Qin, Yuanzhen Li, Chen Sun, Michael Rubinstein, Deqing Sun, Kaiming He, Yonglong Tian",2024-10-17,"Scaling up autoregressive models in vision has not proven as beneficial as in
large language models. In this work, we investigate this scaling problem in the
context of text-to-image generation, focusing on two critical factors: whether
models use discrete or continuous tokens, and whether tokens are generated in a
random or fixed raster order using BERT- or GPT-like transformer architectures.
Our empirical results show that, while all models scale effectively in terms of
validation loss, their evaluation performance -- measured by FID, GenEval
score, and visual quality -- follows different trends. Models based on
continuous tokens achieve significantly better visual quality than those using
discrete tokens. Furthermore, the generation order and attention mechanisms
significantly affect the GenEval score: random-order models achieve notably
better GenEval scores compared to raster-order models. Inspired by these
findings, we train Fluid, a random-order autoregressive model on continuous
tokens. Fluid 10.5B model achieves a new state-of-the-art zero-shot FID of 6.16
on MS-COCO 30K, and 0.69 overall score on the GenEval benchmark. We hope our
findings and results will encourage future efforts to further bridge the
scaling gap between vision and language models.",machine learning
How Numerical Precision Affects Mathematical Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs,"Guhao Feng, Kai Yang, Yuntian Gu, Xinyue Ai, Shengjie Luo, Jiacheng Sun, Di He, Zhenguo Li, Liwei Wang",2024-10-17,"Despite the remarkable success of Transformer-based Large Language Models
(LLMs) across various domains, understanding and enhancing their mathematical
capabilities remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we conduct a
rigorous theoretical analysis of LLMs' mathematical abilities, with a specific
focus on their arithmetic performances. We identify numerical precision as a
key factor that influences their effectiveness in mathematical tasks. Our
results show that Transformers operating with low numerical precision fail to
address arithmetic tasks, such as iterated addition and integer multiplication,
unless the model size grows super-polynomially with respect to the input
length. In contrast, Transformers with standard numerical precision can
efficiently handle these tasks with significantly smaller model sizes. We
further support our theoretical findings through empirical experiments that
explore the impact of varying numerical precision on arithmetic tasks,
providing valuable insights for improving the mathematical reasoning
capabilities of LLMs.",machine learning
Diffusing States and Matching Scores: A New Framework for Imitation Learning,"Runzhe Wu, Yiding Chen, Gokul Swamy, Kianté Brantley, Wen Sun",2024-10-17,"Adversarial Imitation Learning is traditionally framed as a two-player
zero-sum game between a learner and an adversarially chosen cost function, and
can therefore be thought of as the sequential generalization of a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN). A prominent example of this framework is Generative
Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL). However, in recent years, diffusion
models have emerged as a non-adversarial alternative to GANs that merely
require training a score function via regression, yet produce generations of a
higher quality. In response, we investigate how to lift insights from diffusion
modeling to the sequential setting. We propose diffusing states and performing
score-matching along diffused states to measure the discrepancy between the
expert's and learner's states. Thus, our approach only requires training score
functions to predict noises via standard regression, making it significantly
easier and more stable to train than adversarial methods. Theoretically, we
prove first- and second-order instance-dependent bounds with linear scaling in
the horizon, proving that our approach avoids the compounding errors that
stymie offline approaches to imitation learning. Empirically, we show our
approach outperforms GAN-style imitation learning baselines across various
continuous control problems, including complex tasks like controlling humanoids
to walk, sit, and crawl.",machine learning

Retrospective Learning from Interactions,"Zizhao Chen, Mustafa Omer Gul, Yiwei Chen, Gloria Geng, Anne Wu, Yoav Artzi",2024-10-17,"Multi-turn interactions between large language models (LLMs) and users
naturally include implicit feedback signals. If an LLM responds in an
unexpected way to an instruction, the user is likely to signal it by rephrasing
the request, expressing frustration, or pivoting to an alternative task. Such
signals are task-independent and occupy a relatively constrained subspace of
language, allowing the LLM to identify them even if it fails on the actual
task. This creates an avenue for continually learning from interactions without
additional annotations. We introduce ReSpect, a method to learn from such
signals in past interactions via retrospection. We deploy ReSpect in a new
multimodal interaction scenario, where humans instruct an LLM to solve an
abstract reasoning task with a combinatorial solution space. Through thousands
of interactions with humans, we show how ReSpect gradually improves task
completion rate from 31% to 82%, all without any external annotation.",machine learning
Influence Functions for Scalable Data Attribution in Diffusion Models,"Bruno Mlodozeniec, Runa Eschenhagen, Juhan Bae, Alexander Immer, David Krueger, Richard Turner",2024-10-17,"Diffusion models have led to significant advancements in generative
modelling. Yet their widespread adoption poses challenges regarding data
attribution and interpretability. In this paper, we aim to help address such
challenges in diffusion models by developing an \textit{influence functions}
framework. Influence function-based data attribution methods approximate how a
model's output would have changed if some training data were removed. In
supervised learning, this is usually used for predicting how the loss on a
particular example would change. For diffusion models, we focus on predicting
the change in the probability of generating a particular example via several
proxy measurements. We show how to formulate influence functions for such
quantities and how previously proposed methods can be interpreted as particular
design choices in our framework. To ensure scalability of the Hessian
computations in influence functions, we systematically develop K-FAC
approximations based on generalised Gauss-Newton matrices specifically tailored
to diffusion models. We recast previously proposed methods as specific design
choices in our framework and show that our recommended method outperforms
previous data attribution approaches on common evaluations, such as the Linear
Data-modelling Score (LDS) or retraining without top influences, without the
need for method-specific hyperparameter tuning.",machine learning
From Gradient Clipping to Normalization for Heavy Tailed SGD,"Florian Hübler, Ilyas Fatkhullin, Niao He",2024-10-17,"Recent empirical evidence indicates that many machine learning applications
involve heavy-tailed gradient noise, which challenges the standard assumptions
of bounded variance in stochastic optimization. Gradient clipping has emerged
as a popular tool to handle this heavy-tailed noise, as it achieves good
performance in this setting both theoretically and practically. However, our
current theoretical understanding of non-convex gradient clipping has three
main shortcomings. First, the theory hinges on large, increasing clipping
thresholds, which are in stark contrast to the small constant clipping
thresholds employed in practice. Second, clipping thresholds require knowledge
of problem-dependent parameters to guarantee convergence. Lastly, even with
this knowledge, current sampling complexity upper bounds for the method are
sub-optimal in nearly all parameters. To address these issues, we study
convergence of Normalized SGD (NSGD). First, we establish a parameter-free
sample complexity for NSGD of
$\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-\frac{2p}{p-1}}\right)$ to find an
$\varepsilon$-stationary point. Furthermore, we prove tightness of this result,
by providing a matching algorithm-specific lower bound. In the setting where
all problem parameters are known, we show this complexity is improved to
$\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-\frac{3p-2}{p-1}}\right)$, matching the
previously known lower bound for all first-order methods in all problem
dependent parameters. Finally, we establish high-probability convergence of
NSGD with a mild logarithmic dependence on the failure probability. Our work
complements the studies of gradient clipping under heavy tailed noise improving
the sample complexities of existing algorithms and offering an alternative
mechanism to achieve high probability convergence.",machine learning
SimLayerKV: A Simple Framework for Layer-Level KV Cache Reduction,"Xuan Zhang, Cunxiao Du, Chao Du, Tianyu Pang, Wei Gao, Min Lin",2024-10-17,"Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their
capabilities to handle long contexts. However, increasing the number of model
layers and the length of input sequences significantly escalates the memory
required to store key-value (KV) cache, posing challenges for efficient
inference. To mitigate this issue, we present SimLayerKV, a simple yet
effective method that reduces inter-layer KV cache redundancies by selectively
dropping cache in identified lazy layers. Our approach is based on the
observation that certain layers in long-context LLMs exhibit ""lazy"" behavior,
contributing less to modeling long-range dependencies compared to non-lazy
layers. By analyzing attention weight patterns, we find that the behavior of
these lazy layers is consistent across tokens during generation for a given
input. This insight motivates our SimLayerKV, which identifies lazy layers and
reduces their KV cache accordingly. SimLayerKV is training-free, generalizable,
and can be implemented with only seven lines of code. We conduct extensive
experiments on three representative LLMs, e.g., LLaMA2-7B, LLaMA3-8B, and
Mistral-7B across 16 tasks from the LongBench benchmark. The results
demonstrate that SimLayerKV achieves a KV cache compression ratio of 5$\times$

A Unified View of Delta Parameter Editing in Post-Trained Large-Scale Models,"Qiaoyu Tang, Le Yu, Bowen Yu, Hongyu Lin, Keming Lu, Yaojie Lu, Xianpei Han, Le Sun",2024-10-17,"Post-training has emerged as a crucial paradigm for adapting large-scale
pre-trained models to various tasks, whose effects are fully reflected by delta
parameters (i.e., the disparity between post-trained and pre-trained
parameters). While numerous studies have explored delta parameter properties
via operations like pruning, quantization, low-rank approximation, and
extrapolation, a unified framework for systematically examining these
characteristics has been lacking. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective
based on Riemann sum approximation of the loss function to elucidate delta
parameter editing operations. Our analysis categorizes existing methods into
three classes based on their post-editing performance: competitive, decreased,
and improved, explaining how they are expressed by the Riemann sum
approximation term and how they alter the model performance. Extensive
experiments on both visual and language models, including ViT, LLaMA 3, Qwen 2,
and Mistral, corroborate our theoretical findings. Furthermore, we introduce
extensions to existing techniques like DARE and BitDelta, highlighting their
limitations in leveraging the properties of delta parameters and reorganizing

ORSO: Accelerating Reward Design via Online Reward Selection and Policy Optimization,"Chen Bo Calvin Zhang, Zhang-Wei Hong, Aldo Pacchiano, Pulkit Agrawal",2024-10-17,"Reward shaping is a critical component in reinforcement learning (RL),

novel approach that frames shaping reward selection as an online model

automatically identify promising shaping reward functions without human

stochastic infidelity minimization and discretization of the unitary evolution.
We investigate neural infidelity minimization using natural gradient descent
strategies, identifying the most stable stochastic estimators and introducing
adaptive regularization strategies that eliminate the need for manual
adjustment of the hyperparameter along the dynamics. We formalize the specific
requirements that p-tVMC imposes on discretization schemes for them to be
efficient, and introduce four high-order integration schemes combining Taylor
expansions, Pad\'e approximants, and Trotter splitting to enhance accuracy and
scalability. We benchmark our adaptive methods against a 2D Ising quench,
matching state of the art techniques without manual tuning of hyperparameters.

Neural Quantum States and Peaked Molecular Wave Functions: Curse or Blessing?,"Aleksei Malyshev, Markus Schmitt, A. I. Lvovsky",2024-08-14,"The field of neural quantum states has recently experienced a tremendous
progress, making them a competitive tool of computational quantum many-body
physics. However, their largest achievements to date mostly concern interacting
spin systems, while their utility for quantum chemistry remains yet to be
demonstrated. Two main complications are the peaked structure of the molecular
wave functions, which impedes sampling, and large number of terms in second
quantised Hamiltonians, which hinders scaling to larger molecule sizes. In this
paper we address these issues jointly and argue that the peaked structure might
actually be key to drastically more efficient calculations. Specifically, we
introduce a novel algorithm for autoregressive sampling without replacement and
a procedure to calculate a computationally cheaper surrogate for the local
energy. We complement them with a custom modification of the stochastic
reconfiguration optimisation technique and a highly optimised GPU
implementation. As a result, our calculations require substantially less
resources and exhibit more than order of magnitude speedup compared to the

A Tutorial on the Use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to Compute the Spectrum of Quantum Systems,"Lorenzo Brevi, Antonio Mandarino, Enrico Prati",2024-07-30,"Quantum many-body systems are of great interest for many research areas,
including physics, biology and chemistry. However, their simulation is
extremely challenging, due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with
the system size, making it exceedingly difficult to parameterize the wave
functions of large systems by using exact methods. Neural networks and machine
learning in general are a way to face this challenge. For instance, methods
like Tensor networks and Neural Quantum States are being investigated as
promising tools to obtain the wave function of a quantum mechanical system. In
this tutorial, we focus on a particularly promising class of deep learning
algorithms. We explain how to construct a Physics-Informed Neural Network
(PINN) able to solve the Schr\""odinger equation for a given potential, by
finding its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. This technique is unsupervised, and
utilizes a novel computational method in a manner that is barely explored.
PINNs are a deep learning method that exploits Automatic Differentiation to
solve Integro-Differential Equations in a mesh-free way. We show how to find
both the ground and the excited states. The method discovers the states
progressively by starting from the ground state. We explain how to introduce
inductive biases in the loss to exploit further knowledge of the physical
system. Such additional constraints allow for a faster and more accurate
convergence. This technique can then be enhanced by a smart choice of
collocation points in order to take advantage of the mesh-free nature of the
PINN. The methods are made explicit by applying them to the infinite potential
well and the particle in a ring, a challenging problem to be learned by an

Quantum states from normalizing flows,"Scott Lawrence, Arlee Shelby, Yukari Yamauchi",2024-06-04,"We introduce an architecture for neural quantum states for many-body

Neural Quantum States in Variational Monte Carlo Method: A Brief Summary,Yuntai Song,2024-06-03,"In this note, variational Monte Carlo method based on neural quantum states
for spin systems is reviewed. Using a neural network as the wave function
allows for a more generalized expression of various types of interactions,
including highly non-local interactions, which are closely related to its
non-linear activation functions. Additionally, neural networks can represent
relatively complex wave functions with relatively small computational resources
when dealing with higher-dimensional systems, which is undoubtedly a
""flattening"" advantage. In quantum-state tomography, the representation method
of neural quantum states has already achieved significant results, hinting at
its potential in handling larger-sized systems.",neural quantum states
Transformer neural networks and quantum simulators: a hybrid approach for simulating strongly correlated systems,"Hannah Lange, Guillaume Bornet, Gabriel Emperauger, Cheng Chen, Thierry Lahaye, Stefan Kienle, Antoine Browaeys, Annabelle Bohrdt",2024-05-31,"Owing to their great expressivity and versatility, neural networks have
gained attention for simulating large two-dimensional quantum many-body
systems. However, their expressivity comes with the cost of a challenging
optimization due to the in general rugged and complicated loss landscape. Here,
we present a hybrid optimization scheme for neural quantum states (NQS) that
involves a data-driven pretraining with numerical or experimental data and a
second, Hamiltonian-driven optimization stage. By using both projective
measurements from the computational basis as well as expectation values from
other measurement configurations such as spin-spin correlations, our
pretraining gives access to the sign structure of the state, yielding improved
and faster convergence that is robust w.r.t. experimental imperfections and
limited datasets. We apply the hybrid scheme to the ground state search for the
2D transverse field Ising model and the 2D dipolar XY model on $6\times 6$ and
$10\times 10$ square lattices with a patched transformer wave function, using
numerical and experimental data from a programmable Rydberg quantum simulator
[Chen et al., Nature 616 (2023)], with snapshots of the quantum system obtained
from the different measurement configurations, and show that the information
from the second basis highly improves the performance. Our work paves the way
for a reliable and efficient optimization of neural quantum states.",neural quantum states
Ground state phases of the two-dimension electron gas with a unified variational approach,"Conor Smith, Yixiao Chen, Ryan Levy, Yubo Yang, Miguel A. Morales, Shiwei Zhang",2024-05-29,"The two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) is a fundamental model, which is
drawing increasing interest because of recent advances in experimental and
theoretical studies of 2D materials. Current understanding of the ground state
of the 2DEG relies on quantum Monte Carlo calculations, based on variational
comparisons of different ansatze for different phases. We use a single
variational ansatz, a general backflow-type wave function using a
message-passing neural quantum state architecture, for a unified description
across the entire density range. The variational optimization consistently
leads to lower ground-state energies than previous best results. Transition
into a Wigner crystal (WC) phase occurs automatically at rs = 37 +/- 1, a
density lower than currently believed. Between the liquid and WC phases, the
same ansatz and variational search strongly suggest the existence of
intermediate states in a broad range of densities, with enhanced short-range
nematic spin correlations.",neural quantum states
Structure and dynamics of electron-phonon coupled systems using neural quantum states,"Ankit Mahajan, Paul J. Robinson, Joonho Lee, David R. Reichman",2024-05-14,"In this work, we use neural quantum states (NQS) to describe the
high-dimensional wave functions of electron-phonon coupled systems. We
demonstrate that NQS can accurately and systematically learn the underlying
physics of such problems through a variational Monte Carlo optimization of the
energy with minimal incorporation of physical information even in highly
challenging cases. We assess the ability of our approach across various lattice
model examples featuring different types of couplings. The flexibility of our
NQS formulation is demonstrated via application to ab initio models
parametrized by density functional perturbation theory consisting of electron
or hole bands coupled linearly to dispersive phonons. We compute accurate
real-frequency spectral properties of electron-phonon systems via a novel
formalism based on NQS. Our work establishes a general framework for exploring
diverse ground state and dynamical phenomena arising in electron-phonon
systems, including the non-perturbative interplay of correlated electronic and
electron-phonon effects in systems ranging from simple lattice models to
realistic models of materials parametrized by ab initio calculations.",neural quantum states
Position Specific Scoring Is All You Need? Revisiting Protein Sequence Classification Tasks,"Sarwan Ali, Taslim Murad, Prakash Chourasia, Haris Mansoor, Imdad Ullah Khan, Pin-Yu Chen, Murray Patterson",2024-10-16,"Understanding the structural and functional characteristics of proteins are
crucial for developing preventative and curative strategies that impact fields
from drug discovery to policy development. An important and popular technique
for examining how amino acids make up these characteristics of the protein
sequences with position-specific scoring (PSS). While the string kernel is
crucial in natural language processing (NLP), it is unclear if string kernels
can extract biologically meaningful information from protein sequences, despite
the fact that they have been shown to be effective in the general sequence
analysis tasks. In this work, we propose a weighted PSS kernel matrix (or
W-PSSKM), that combines a PSS representation of protein sequences, which
encodes the frequency information of each amino acid in a sequence, with the
notion of the string kernel. This results in a novel kernel function that
outperforms many other approaches for protein sequence classification. We
perform extensive experimentation to evaluate the proposed method. Our findings
demonstrate that the W-PSSKM significantly outperforms existing baselines and
state-of-the-art methods and achieves up to 45.1\% improvement in

Reddit is all you need: Authorship profiling for Romanian,"Ecaterina Ştefănescu, Alexandru-Iulius Jerpelea",2024-10-13,"Authorship profiling is the process of identifying an author's
characteristics based on their writings. This centuries old problem has become
more intriguing especially with recent developments in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). In this paper, we introduce a corpus of short texts in the
Romanian language, annotated with certain author characteristic keywords; to
our knowledge, the first of its kind. In order to do this, we exploit a social
media platform called Reddit. We leverage its thematic community-based
structure (subreddits structure), which offers information about the author's
background. We infer an user's demographic and some broad personal traits, such
as age category, employment status, interests, and social orientation based on
the subreddit and other cues. We thus obtain a 23k+ samples corpus, extracted
from 100+ Romanian subreddits. We analyse our dataset, and finally, we

Dying Clusters Is All You Need -- Deep Clustering With an Unknown Number of Clusters,"Collin Leiber, Niklas Strauß, Matthias Schubert, Thomas Seidl",2024-10-12,"Finding meaningful groups, i.e., clusters, in high-dimensional data such as
images or texts without labeled data at hand is an important challenge in data
mining. In recent years, deep clustering methods have achieved remarkable
results in these tasks. However, most of these methods require the user to
specify the number of clusters in advance. This is a major limitation since the
number of clusters is typically unknown if labeled data is unavailable. Thus,
an area of research has emerged that addresses this problem. Most of these
approaches estimate the number of clusters separated from the clustering
process. This results in a strong dependency of the clustering result on the
quality of the initial embedding. Other approaches are tailored to specific
clustering processes, making them hard to adapt to other scenarios. In this
paper, we propose UNSEEN, a general framework that, starting from a given upper
bound, is able to estimate the number of clusters. To the best of our
knowledge, it is the first method that can be easily combined with various deep
clustering algorithms. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by
combining UNSEEN with the popular deep clustering algorithms DCN, DEC, and DKM
and verify its effectiveness through an extensive experimental evaluation on
several image and tabular datasets. Moreover, we perform numerous ablations to
analyze our approach and show the importance of its components. The code is

Looped ReLU MLPs May Be All You Need as Practical Programmable Computers,"Yingyu Liang, Zhizhou Sha, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Yufa Zhou",2024-10-12,"Previous work has demonstrated that attention mechanisms are Turing complete.
More recently, it has been shown that a looped 13-layer Transformer can
function as a universal programmable computer. In contrast, the multi-layer
perceptrons with $\mathsf{ReLU}$ activation ($\mathsf{ReLU}$-$\mathsf{MLP}$),
one of the most fundamental components of neural networks, is known to be
expressive; specifically, a two-layer neural network is a universal
approximator given an exponentially large number of hidden neurons. However, it
remains unclear whether a $\mathsf{ReLU}$-$\mathsf{MLP}$ can be made into a
universal programmable computer using a practical number of weights. In this
work, we provide an affirmative answer that a looped 23-layer
$\mathsf{ReLU}$-$\mathsf{MLP}$ is capable to perform the basic necessary
operations, effectively functioning as a programmable computer. This indicates
that simple modules have stronger expressive power than previously expected and
have not been fully explored. Our work provides insights into the mechanisms of
neural networks and demonstrates that complex tasks, such as functioning as a
programmable computer, do not necessarily require advanced architectures like

Rethinking Data Selection at Scale: Random Selection is Almost All You Need,"Tingyu Xia, Bowen Yu, Kai Dang, An Yang, Yuan Wu, Yuan Tian, Yi Chang, Junyang Lin",2024-10-12,"Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is crucial for aligning Large Language Models
(LLMs) with human instructions. The primary goal during SFT is to select a
small yet representative subset of training data from the larger pool, such
that fine-tuning with this subset achieves results comparable to or even
exceeding those obtained using the entire dataset. However, most existing data
selection techniques are designed for small-scale data pools, which fail to
meet the demands of real-world SFT scenarios. In this paper, we replicated
several self-scoring methods those that do not rely on external model
assistance on two million scale datasets, and found that nearly all methods
struggled to significantly outperform random selection when dealing with such
large-scale data pools. Moreover, our comparisons suggest that, during SFT,
diversity in data selection is more critical than simply focusing on high
quality data. We also analyzed the limitations of several current approaches,
explaining why they perform poorly on large-scale datasets and why they are
unsuitable for such contexts. Finally, we found that filtering data by token
length offers a stable and efficient method for improving results. This
approach, particularly when training on long text data, proves highly
beneficial for relatively weaker base models, such as Llama3.",all you need
Simulation-based inference with scattering representations: scattering is all you need,"Kiyam Lin, Benjamin Joachimi, Jason D. McEwen",2024-10-11,"We demonstrate the first successful use of scattering representations without
further compression for simulation-based inference (SBI) with images (i.e.
field-level), illustrated with a cosmological case study. Scattering
representations provide a highly effective representational space for
subsequent learning tasks, although the higher dimensional compressed space
introduces challenges. We overcome these through spatial averaging, coupled
with more expressive density estimators. Compared to alternative methods, such
an approach does not require additional simulations for either training or
computing derivatives, is interpretable, and resilient to covariate shift. As

Noise is All You Need: Private Second-Order Convergence of Noisy SGD,"Dmitrii Avdiukhin, Michael Dinitz, Chenglin Fan, Grigory Yaroslavtsev",2024-10-09,"Private optimization is a topic of major interest in machine learning, with
differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) playing a key role
in both theory and practice. Furthermore, DP-SGD is known to be a powerful tool
in contexts beyond privacy, including robustness, machine unlearning, etc.
Existing analyses of DP-SGD either make relatively strong assumptions (e.g.,
Lipschitz continuity of the loss function, or even convexity) or prove only
first-order convergence (and thus might end at a saddle point in the non-convex
setting). At the same time, there has been progress in proving second-order
convergence of the non-private version of ``noisy SGD'', as well as progress in
designing algorithms that are more complex than DP-SGD and do guarantee
second-order convergence. We revisit DP-SGD and show that ``noise is all you
need'': the noise necessary for privacy already implies second-order
convergence under the standard smoothness assumptions, even for non-Lipschitz
loss functions. Hence, we get second-order convergence essentially for free:
DP-SGD, the workhorse of modern private optimization, under minimal assumptions
can be used to find a second-order stationary point.",all you need

Grounding is All You Need? Dual Temporal Grounding for Video Dialog,"You Qin, Wei Ji, Xinze Lan, Hao Fei, Xun Yang, Dan Guo, Roger Zimmermann, Lizi Liao",2024-10-08,"In the realm of video dialog response generation, the understanding of video
content and the temporal nuances of conversation history are paramount. While a
segment of current research leans heavily on large-scale pretrained
visual-language models and often overlooks temporal dynamics, another delves
deep into spatial-temporal relationships within videos but demands intricate
object trajectory pre-extractions and sidelines dialog temporal dynamics. This
paper introduces the Dual Temporal Grounding-enhanced Video Dialog model
(DTGVD), strategically designed to merge the strengths of both dominant
approaches. It emphasizes dual temporal relationships by predicting dialog
turn-specific temporal regions, filtering video content accordingly, and
grounding responses in both video and dialog contexts. One standout feature of
DTGVD is its heightened attention to chronological interplay. By recognizing
and acting upon the dependencies between different dialog turns, it captures
more nuanced conversational dynamics. To further bolster the alignment between
video and dialog temporal dynamics, we've implemented a list-wise contrastive
learning strategy. Within this framework, accurately grounded turn-clip
pairings are designated as positive samples, while less precise pairings are
categorized as negative. This refined classification is then funneled into our
holistic end-to-end response generation mechanism. Evaluations using
